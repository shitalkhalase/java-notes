IF THE PROJECT IS REPETETIVE THEN,WE CAN USE AUTOMATION TESTING.

ONE TIME REQUIREMENT PROJECT THEN,WE CAN USE MANUAL TESTING.

*Automation Testing :- Automation Testing is a process of converting any manual  test cases into the test scripts with the help of automation tools or any programming languages. Using a test automation tool, it's possible to record this test suite and re-play it as required. Once the test suite is automated, no human intervention is required.


SELENIUM- IT IS A OPEN SOURCE TOOLS USED TO TEST THE WEB BASED APPLICATION.
It is a free (open source) automated testing suite for web applications across different browsers and platforms.

Webdriver:-WebDriver is an API. It is written in more than one language which and they are called language bindings.The API has functions to control a browser.

FEATURE OF SELENIUM                    **For functional testing-->QTP,Rational robot,Selenium,Auto IT,Coded UI.
1. IT IS FREE.                         **For Non-functional testing-->JMeter,Acunetix,Load Runner.  
2. IT SUPPORT MULTIPLE LANGUAGE.

In Selenium,there is 1 disadvantage,i.e.In Selenium script,we cannot automate the script for image,barcode & (autogenerated) capcha code.

**LOCATOR-(Identity,Property,attribute)TO FIND OUT THE LOCATION OF ELEMENTS,To identify the WebElements.
-->Locators provide a way to access the HTML elements from a web page.
-->In selenium,we can use locators to perform actions on the text-boxes,links,check-boxes & other web elements.
-->They are basic building blocks of a web-page.
*********7 LOCATORS:- ***********************
1. ID         |-->Basic Locators.By.id("Value")
2. NAME       |-->By.name("Value")
3. CLASS NAME |-->By.className("Value")
4. LINKED TEXT|-->Basic Locators ....By.linkText("Displayed Text")-->Linktext shows hyper-Link & its tag-Name is<a>.
5. XPATH :-


***********XPATH:-

1.ABSOLUTE XPATH:-Path is related to the root directory,is called Absolute XPath.Its Prefix is '/'& Shows Root Node.
2.RELATIVE XPATH(COMMONLY USED):-Path is related to the current directory,is called Relative XPath.Its Prefix is '//' & Shows Current Node.(Each root node maps to a volume, such as C:\ or D:\)


************XPATH SYNTAX
                 //HTML_TAG[@ATTRIBUTE='VALUE'] OR //TagName[@Property='PropertyValue']
                                  For Example://input[@type='submit']

6.CSSSelector-->Cascading Style sheet--> TagName[Property='PropertyValue']-->input[type='Submit']

***************************************Alert in Selenium*************************************

Alert in Selenium:-An alert in Selenium is a small message box which appears on screen to give the user some information or notification.
It notifies the user with some specific information or error,asks for permissions to perform certain tasks and it also provides warning messages as well.
Types of Alert:-  
1.Simple Alert.
2.Prompt Alert/Permission Alert.
3.Confirmation Alert.


1.Simple Alert:-This Simple Alert displays some information or warning on the screen.

2.Prompt Alert/Permission Alert:-This Prompt alert asks some input from the user and selenium WebDriver can enter the text using sendKeys("input...."). 

3.Confirmation Alert:-This confirmation alert asks permission to do some type of operation.7276580069->Shruti



********************************************Frameworks in Automation*******************************


-Selenium Framework is a code structure that helps to make code maintenance easy.
-There are mainly 3 types of frameworks created by Selenium Webdriver to automate manual test case.
1.Data-Driven Test Framework
2.Keyword Driven Test Framework
3.Hybrid Test Framework




1)Data Driven Testing Framework:-
-DATA DRIVEN TESTING is a test automation framework that stores test data in a table or spreadsheet format.This allows automation engineers to have a single test script that can execute tests for all the test data in the table.

-In this framework,input values are read from data files and are stored into a variable in test scripts.DDT(Data Driven Testing)enables building both positive and negative test cases into a single test.

-In Data-Driven test automation framework ,input data can be stored in single or multiple  data sources like xls(old),XML(new),csv(Comma seperated value)and databases. 

****************************Advantages of Data-Driven Testing***********************************
-Allows to test application with multiple sets of data values during Regression Testing.

-TESt  data and verification data can be  organized in just one file,and it is seperate from the test case logic.
-Base on the tool,it is possible to have the test scripts in a single repository.This makes the texts easy to understand ,maintain and manage.
-Actions and Functions can be reused in different tests.
-Some tools generate test data automatically.This is useful when large volumes of random test data are necessary,which helps to save the time.
-Allows developers and testers to have clear seperation for the logic of their test cases/scripts from the test data.

****************************************************************************************************************
2) Keyword Driven Testing(Framework):-
- KEYWORD-DRIVEN TESTING(FRAMEWORK) is a scripting technique that uses data files to contain the keywords related to the application being tested. These keywords describe the set of actions that is required to perform a specific step.
-A Keyword-driven test consists of high and low-level keywords, including the keyword arguments, which is composed to describe the action of a test case. It is also called table-driven testing or action word based testing.
-In Keyword Driven testing, you first identify a set of keywords and then associate an action (or function) related to these keywords. Here, every testing action like opening or closing of browser, mouse click, keystrokes etc. is described by a keyword such as openbrowser , click, typetext and so on. 
********************************Advantages of Keyword Driven Testing**********************************
-It allows functional testers to plan test automation before the application is ready.
-Tests can be developed without programming knowledge.
-It is not dependent on a specific programming language or tool.
-Compatible with any automation tools available in the market.


****Implicit, Explicit and Fluent Wait in Selenium WebDriver:-           

In Selenium, “Waits” play an important role in executing tests.

There are different types of waits in Selenium:-


 
1.Implicit Wait in Selenium:-Most of the web applications are developed using Ajax and Javascript. When a page is loaded by the browser the elements which we want to interact with may load at different time intervals.

->The Implicit Wait in Selenium is used to tell the web driver to wait for a certain amount of time before it throws a “No Such Element Exception”. The default setting is 0. Once we set the time, the web driver will wait for the element for that time before throwing an exception.

->Selenium Web Driver has borrowed the idea of implicit waits from Watir.
->It means that if the element is not located on the web page within that time frame, it will throw an exception.

->Not only it makes this difficult to identify the element but also if the element is not located it will throw an “ElementNotVisibleException” exception. Using Selenium Waits, we can resolve this problem.

->Implicit wait will accept 2 parameters, the first parameter will accept the time as an integer value and the second parameter will accept the time measurement in terms of SECONDS, MINUTES, MILISECOND, MICROSECONDS, NANOSECONDS, DAYS, HOURS, etc.

->Suppose we are trying to find an element which has some “ExpectedConditions “(Explicit Wait), If the element is not located within the time frame defined by the Explicit wait(10 Seconds), It will use the time frame defined by implicit wait(20 seconds) before throwing an “ElementNotVisibleException“.


2.Explicit Wait:-
->The Explicit Wait in Selenium is used to tell the Web Driver to wait for certain conditions (Expected Conditions) or maximum time exceeded before throwing “ElementNotVisibleException” exception.

-> It is an intelligent kind of wait, but it can be applied only for specified elements. It gives better options than implicit wait as it waits for dynamically loaded Ajax elements.

->Once we declare explicit wait we have to use “ExpectedConditions” or we can configure how frequently we want to check the condition using Fluent Wait. These days while implementing we are using Thread.Sleep() generally it is not recommended to use


3.Fluent Wait:-The Fluent Wait in Selenium is used to define maximum time for the web driver to wait for a condition, as well as the frequency with which we want to check the condition before throwing an “ElementNotVisibleException” exception. It checks for the web element at regular intervals until the object is found or timeout happens.
***Frequency: Setting up a repeat cycle with the time frame to verify/check the condition at the regular interval of time.


To put it simply, Fluent Wait looks for a web element repeatedly at regular intervals until timeout happens or until the object is found.

Fluent Wait commands are most useful when interacting with web elements that can take longer durations to load. This is something that often occurs in Ajax applications.

While using Fluent Wait, it is possible to set a default polling period as needed. The user can configure the wait to ignore any exceptions during the polling period.

Fluent waits are also sometimes called smart waits because they don’t wait out the entire duration defined in the code. Instead, the test continues to execute as soon as the element is detected – as soon as the condition specified in .until(YourCondition) method becomes true.



*****Web Application Testing - Techniques:
1.Verify there is no dead page or invalid redirects/valid URL or not.
2.First check all the validations on each field.
3.Wrong inputs to perform negative testing.
4.Verify the workflow of the system.
5.Verify the data integrity.
